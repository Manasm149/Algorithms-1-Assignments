# Solutions Coursera - Algorithms, Part I by Princeton University
I took the Algorithms 1 and Algorithms course approximately an year earlier to get familiar with various data structures. During that course I did its's assignments which were very intense and thought me about various concepts. These assignments helped me in my COL 106 course I took in this spring and helped me get an A- there.
# Assignment-1
This assignment estimates the percolation threshold of an n-by-n grid using a Monte Carlo simulation. The percolation threshold is the probability of the cell to open that almost guarantees system percolation. The simulation models the behavior of materials (e.g., metal-insulator composites, porous rocks) to determine the conditions under which a connected path emerges from the top to the bottom of a system.

# Assignment-2
This assignment implements a Dequeu and a Randomized Queue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.
