# Solutions Coursera - Algorithms, Part I by Princeton University
I took the Algorithms 1 and Algorithms course approximately an year earlier to get familiar with various data structures. During that course I did its's assignments which ere very intense and thought me about various concepts.
# Assignment-1
This project estimates the percolation threshold of an n-by-n grid using a Monte Carlo simulation. The percolation threshold is the probability of the cell to open that almost guarantees system percolation. The simulation models the behavior of materials (e.g., metal-insulator composites, porous rocks) to determine the conditions under which a connected path emerges from the top to the bottom of a system.
